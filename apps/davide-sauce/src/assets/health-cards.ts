      "Many sauce producers use bitter pastes and sweeten them with sugar or corn syrup. Davide Sauces stand out by using vine-ripened, hand-selected naturally sweet whole tomatoes. We blend fresh produce into every sauce, cooked in extra virgin olive oil. Carrots add a natural sweetness, resulting in purity, simplicity, and digestibility.\n\nThousands have reported, “I can eat your sauce and it doesn’t bother me.” This has become a trademark of Davide Sauces. Our sauces are nutritionally approved and recommended by nutritionists, dietitians, faculty members at the University of Pittsburgh, and health-conscious foodies. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “The first wealth is health!”",
